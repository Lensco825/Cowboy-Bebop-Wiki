      <div class="backgroundStory">
        <p>
          In 2022, the accidental explosion of an experimental gate device that
          allows for hyperspace travel seriously damages the Moon, causing a
          drift of a swarm of meteorites and asteroids to bombard the surface of
          the planet Earth, wiping out much of the population. The survivors
          then abandoned the now inhospitable planet to colonize new habitable
          systems: Mars, Venus, the asteroid belt, and Jupiter's satellites. By
          2071, the technology of the Astral Gates had stabilized and developed
          thriving civilizations on many of these planets, most notably Mars,
          the new hub of human civilization.

          Politics, society, and economics changed with the times. New
          generations grew up with no memories of the Earth, and ethnic groups
          and nations gave way to planetary allegiances. As these new
          communities flourished, the economy boomed (similar to the economic
          productivity nations encountered after World War II). However, this
          also widened the disparity between the rich and poor, and
          interplanetary crime syndicates began to exert influence over the
          planetary governments and the Inter-Solar System Police (ISSP). In
          order to control the criminal activity, a "bounty-reward scheme" was
          introduced similar to that of the Old West. These new bounty hunters
          of the solar system were therefore often called "cowboys" and had a
          disreputable or envious reputation depending on who one talked to.
        </p>
        <p>
          Technology of the era was a mix of old and new technologies.
          Individuals could own cars or space ships and freely travel the Solar
          System if they had the woolongs (their currency).
